# faceRecognition
Face Recognition System is basically used for identifying or verifying a person in a image or in a frame from video. Most of us use 
front camera of our mobile phone to unlock the phone which uses face recognition system behind the scene  to identify you.

I am using eye blink detection for checking liveness of person in order to prevent bypassing of system by placing a static photo of
an authorized user in front of the webcam.
